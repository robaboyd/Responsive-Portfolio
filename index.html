                <p>Hi! My name is Robert Boyd, but you can call me Bobby. I am an aspiring full stack web developer. I have
                    a degree in Mass Communications from California State University, Sacramento. However, I have always
                    been fascinated by web development ever since my highschool web class. Because of this fascination, I
                    decided to embark on my web development journey.
                </p>
                <p id="secondP">My web development journey started when I got a job in IT. At my new IT job, well, I wasn't
                    actually doing much work. Business was slow, and I was bored. So, I decided to remake their website,
                    and from then on I knew that's what I wanted to do.
                    <br> I remade their website first using Wordpress, however when that was done I decided that I wanted
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I finished the new Wordpress website, I decided that I wanted to learn React. Not knowing how big of a step that was
                    going to be, I watched Youtube video after Youtube video until I remade their website again. My new found
                    fascination for React led me to enroll in a coding bootcamp. At the bootcamp I am ready to hone my coding
                    skills and prepare myself for a web development career.
